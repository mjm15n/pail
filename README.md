# pail
dream it. snap it. share it.

Pail is an IOS mobile application that allows users to record and keep track of what is on their bucket lists. Once an item is checked off the list, the user snaps a picture of the achievement and it is saved in their Scrapbook. The user is also given the option of sharing each success to Facebook.
